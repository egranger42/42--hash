=== Hash Table Extensive Test Suite ===

CREATED TEST FILES:
1. test_rand.h / test_rand.c
   - Random number generation with LCG algorithm
   - uint32 and uint64 random numbers

2. test_rand_str.c
   - Random string generation
   - Random key generation with format "key_<id>_<random>"

3. test_rand_alloc.c
   - Random integer allocation
   - Batch random data generation
   - Memory cleanup functions

4. test_large_scale.c
   - Tests 1 MILLION entries
   - Auto-resizing from 256 to 2097152 capacity
   - Measures insertion performance
   - Execution time: ~0.65 seconds

5. test_stress.c
   - 30,000+ random operations (exceeds 15k requirement)
   - Mixed add/get/delete operations
   - Tests load factor handling
   - Shows operation distribution and timing

6. test_growth.c
   - Tests table growth with 100k entries
   - Phase 1: Growth (4 -> 262144 capacity)
   - Phase 2: Verification (retrieve all entries)
   - Phase 3: Deletion (remove 50% of entries)
   - Phase 4: Re-adding (restore 25% of deleted)

TEST RESULTS:
✓ test_large_scale: 1,000,000 entries added successfully
✓ test_stress: 30,000 operations (9786 adds, 10099 gets, 10115 deletes)
✓ test_growth: 100,000 entries with growth/shrink cycles

MAKEFILE:
